        Vision - NexGen ML is a platform of future where communities &ndash;
        common users to content creators, innovators, business houses - will be
        able to control, monitor and monetize their data on their own terms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mission - We help empower communities to own and monetize data in the
        decentralized world. Our advanced Blockchain AI solutions help with data
        automation, leading to new products, new services, tweaks to existing
        products to make them less costly or more valuable, and an array of
        other advantages. Ultimately, this will make the token more competitive
        in the rapidly changing digital landscape.&nbsp;

      <p>Wheel Rewards</p>
      <br />
      <p>An authentic experience that your token holders will love</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Engaged. Devoted. Loyal. Does this describe our Token Holders? It
        can.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Daily Rewards: Wheel Rewards are powered by an advanced automation
        engine that looks into blocks every 6 hours, picks the top 25 holders
        (based on max transactions size by wallet), and puts them on a wheel.
        The wheel runs at a predetermined time and selects three winners; in a
        day, we pick 12 winners.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our advanced automation engine rewards long-term holders. Every wallet
        buy &amp; hold is considered for long-term holder rewards. AI marshaling
        service considers different awards based on the days the token is held,
        and all winners are picked in an automated fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
